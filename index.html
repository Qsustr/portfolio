        <p>I fixed everything the last feedback told.</p>
        <p>Changed out the “y” and “x” variable/arguments name and added in a more descriptive name. On question 3 I replaced the argument name from “y” to “game”. On question 4 I replaced “x” with “dislike” as these are more descriptive.</p>
        <p>I fixed question 5 so that boolean values true/false would not be converted/accepted as 0 and 1. The “convertrguments” function now checks if the passed in arguments is booleans, and numbers. But when the value is not a number, I get the error NaN instead of the “invalid argument” value as it should show - tried for a long time to fix this.
        </p>
        <p>I fixed so that the docent move when the page changes (question 6), I first needed to make the a link and then change the color on it.</p>
        <p>I moved the variable “sum” inside the function so that the result dosent get multiplied when button is pressed.
        </p>
        <p>Wanted to style the page better, but since the assignment already gave CSS styling I didn’t know if I could change it or not.

        <p>I changed the design of the site, so it’s more up to date and more professional looking. I used SASS and followed the dry principle. I designed a better loading indicator, so when waiting for the API result it’s spinning, before it was just text. Changed the cards to equal height despite image height 
            Added in breakpoints for the cards on iPads/mobile, it didn’t have it before, so now it looks good on smaller screens also.</p>
        <p>I cleaned up the javascript, so that’s it formatted better and also changed some variables names to more descriptive names. Also exporting some functions, like the baseURL and errorY functions. Before it didn’t have it. On the contact page, the user gets an indication that the form is sent, by the buttons innerHTML changes to “sent”. Before it didn’t give have it.
        </p>
        <p>Changed some HTML. Added in more info about the dogs on the specific cards. Added in breadcrumbs. Removed “home” from the nav, since “dog breeds” gets u back to the home page. Cleaned up the HTML, removed ul/li from the nav, added in a wrapper and container for the layout.</p>
        <p>All of the pages have H1 now. Added in alt descriptions for images.</p>
        <p>Considered to add in an input field to that the user could search for breeds, but assignment didn’t ask for it so was unsure if I could.</p>

      <h2>Semester project 1</h2>
      <p class="link">Link to the page:</p>
      <p>The whole site got a new design. Added in more colours, as the last assignment didn’t have a lot, so now its more fitting for the target audience. Also changed some fonts, to make the whole design more fitting. Added in more pictures on the different pages. Changed the logo so now its pure text instead of a picture. Added in more elements so that its geared toward target audience. Styled the site using SASS. Added in wrapper and containers for the layout.</p>
      <p>Also added in javascript on to the site, the site didn’t have anything before. On the contact page, I added in error messages when the user types in the wrong values, also added in an indication when the form is sent - the button changes. </p>
      <p>All in all, I cleaned up the code, all of the pages has one h1 and all of the images has descriptive alt text. Removed the search function, was unsure if I should remove it but it felt redundant. All pages have an descriptive meta description and title. Also changed the pages, so now its one “news” page and one “exhibition” page, as it gives more focus on that. Removed the “contribute” page, and instead placed information about the donation to the museum. I fixed the stray and end tags in th HTML, fixed the lists (ul/li).
